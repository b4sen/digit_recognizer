## Digit Recognizer
I created a very basic CNN in PyTorch and trained the model on the MNIST dataset using Google Colabs GPU.
The user can draw a numerical digit on a pygame canvas and the model tries to recognize it.
This project is still WIP, but the basic functionalities are working.

use the `digit_recognizer.py` as entrypoint.
